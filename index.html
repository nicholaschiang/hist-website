                    <h5>Reliability and Redundancy</h5>
                    <p>When you ask for <a href="google.com">www.google.com</a> from your web browser, you usually
                        (I hope) don't worry about not being able to connect. It always works (well, besides that
                        one time where you didn't have WiFi turned on). You don't have to think about it. And
                        you shouldn't.</p>
                    <p>The Internet was designed in such a way that all packets (the data
                        that gets sent between your computer and Google's servers) should make
                        their way to their destination, even if the power in Iraq is down or the IXP that you normally
                        connect to is under maintenance.</p>
                    <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) routes packets
                        systematically through the quickest avaliable routes, instead of using preset routes that could
                        become compromised. Thus, the more routers/pathways that are added to the system, the more
                        reliable the Internet becomes. But this reliability comes at a cost.

                <div class="text-box js--fadeInRight">
                    <h5>Internet Service Providers</h5>
                    <p>Imagine that you’re in Los Angeles, and want to take a sip of
                        the Colorado River watershed from your kitchen faucet for free,
                        without paying an existing water utility. How would you do it?
                        You’d need to construct your own ‘private line’ aqueduct from your
                        house to a tributary, and somehow avoid prosecution for siphoning
                        off a controlled resource. Otherwise, you’d need access to pumping
                        stations, valves, existing aqueducts, dams, etc. In short, you’d
                        need to become your own private water utility, whether you
                        interconnect with other existing water utilities or not.</p>
                    <p>Because people can’t see or touch IP packets, they seem to think
                        their delivery is just an abstraction. It’s not. Internet access
                        requires real physical infrastructure just like gas, water,
                        electricity, and sewage. Protocols layered on top of that
                        infrastructure still require the underlying infrastructure for
                        delivery.</p>
                    <p>Internet service providers maintain and upgrade that infrastructure,
                        ensuring that you'll always be able to access <a href="google.com">www.google.com</a>
                        in a timely manner.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="left-container">
                <div class="text-box js--fadeInLeft">
                    <h5>Infrastructure and Utility</h5>
                    <p>The Internet is sort of like any other utility. To connect, you pay your ISP (e.g. AT&T, XFinity)
                        for certain "internet speeds" every month. But the Internet is just a bunch of inter-connected
                        computers, right? Why do I need to pay to talk with other computers? Lets say you <i>really</i> didn't
                        want to pay for Internet. You would have to, in a sense, wire your computer directly to an IXP (something
                        that isn't going to happen anytime soon). It's almost like you didn't want to pay for water.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-box js--fadeInLeft">
                    <h5>Net Neutrality</h5>
                    <p>But ISPs, like any other business, have to make money. And while they
                        definitely do take their cut from your utility bills, they are being
                        paid for much more. Whenever you try to reference a URL or site that
                        doesn't point anymore, ISPs jump in and use that oppurtunity to show
                        you "related content". Content that they are paid to show you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recently, there have been actions regarding "net neutrality" laws.
                        Such laws would, in theory, protect the rights of individuals on the net
                        and ensure that no one individual or company (e.g. ISPs) has power over
                        what can be accessed on the web.
                    </p>
